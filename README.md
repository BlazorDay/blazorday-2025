**The Blazor Day Adventure**

**Blazor Day** is an online event dedicated to Blazor technologies.

Originally launched by three MVP friends (Adrien, Christophe, and Denis)
this event was created to share their passion for .NET, and especially for Blazor.

Blazor is part of the [ASP.NET Core framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/) and is offered as an [open-source](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/) project by Microsoft.
